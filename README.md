                           project within the organization which can help the HR or other senior employees of the company to mave their 
                           employee from one project to other or they can to keep TRACK OF WHAT THEIR EMPLOYEE are doing within the 
                           organization.
                           
                           Here there are Hr's , Admins and employess and only Hr's can create salaries and admins can create roles 
                           and employes cannot see the salaries
